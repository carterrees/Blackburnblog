<p>The purpose of this post is to give an example of how to visualize a quadratic linear regression and also how to find the value’s of the predictor variable which give you the min and max fitted values of your outcome of interest.</p>
<p>I was recently asked to look at relationships between server average query times and variables such as number of query counts, physical devices vs. AWS, disk utilization, number of nodes on a device, etc. The two main research questions were 1) what variables have significant associations with average query times and 2) what values of the predictor variables produce the mininmum average query times.</p>
<p>I like many other data scientists, researchers, statisticians (whomever) like to start every project with simple methods. You can learn a lot from descriptive statistics. If you remember your intro stats course from college there is a chance that simple linear regression was taught in the descriptives section. An exmaple of using this method is below.</p>

  filter(this != this)</code></pre>
